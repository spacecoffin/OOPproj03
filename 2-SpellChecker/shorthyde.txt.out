    "He is not easy to describe.  There is something wrong with his
appearance; something displeasing, something down-right
detestable.  I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce
know why.  He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong
feeling of deformity, although I couldn't specify the point.  He's
an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing
out of the way.  No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can't
describe him.  And it's not want of memory; for I declare I can
see him this moment."

    Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously
under a weight of consideration.  "You are sure he used a key?" he
inquired at last.

    "My dear sir ..." began Enfield, surprised out of himself.

    Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of
ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their
high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and
conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and
the agents of obscure enterprises.  One house, however, second
from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of
this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was
now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr. Utterson
stopped and knocked.  A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the
door.
