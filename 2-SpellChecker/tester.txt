While checking for spelling errors, the spellCheck program takes each word and first looks for it in the primary dictionary. If the word does not appear in the primary dictio- nary, it then looks in the secondary dictionary. This order of looking first in the primary dictionary and then in the secondary dictionary is quite important. If the word is not found in either dictionary, spellCheck will flag the word as being mispelled.
